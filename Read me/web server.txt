Verifying Production Build (Test Server)
User wants validation that "production mode" is active.

The "Test Server" (Port 4040) runs npm run preview, which serves the dist/ folder (Production Build).
The "Live Server" (Port 5050) runs npm run dev (Development Mode).
I will verify the dist/ folder exists and was recently updated to confirm the production build succeeded.
